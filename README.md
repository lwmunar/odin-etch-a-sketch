# odin-etch-a-sketch
TOP's Project: Etch-a-Sketch

To-Do:
- initial structure with fixed values
- arbitrary size of square: 30px by 30px due to 500px by 500px initial constraints and gap consideration

- add hover effect
- add button to prompt sketchpad size and reset workspace
- enhance auto-scaling with respect to aspect-ratio
- check possibility to auto-set height and width size according to user prompt thru JavaScript

- add optional style effects, centering, etc.

Notes:
- box-sizing: border-box; allows squares to collapse internally
